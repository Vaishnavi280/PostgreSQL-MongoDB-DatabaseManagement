Database Analytics(using ETL,EDA)

The integration and analysis of three related
datasets about books that are sold in bookstores is the main
aim of this project analysis. The two structured CSV datasets
and one semi-structured JSON dataset were carefully selected
to allow for the logical connections.<br> Extract, Transform, Load
(ETL) process was performed, that is the process of integrating
the datasets into MongoDB programmatically using Python in
the Jupyter Notebook environment was done. Then, in this
analysis Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was carried out, which
involved thorough analysis, pre-processing, and visualization. A
range of visuals, like graphs and histograms, were utilized to
study and evaluate the variables like book availability by genre
and total and individual count of books according to their
category. And then finally after the processing of data and
adding insights from the EDA, the data was programmatically
stored in PostgreSQL respectively. Therefore, the project's
methodology and goals are summarized in this abstract in
detail, which also covers the important phases of dataset
integration, ETL, EDA, and storage.
